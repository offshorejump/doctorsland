# Doctor's Land 
{Doctors Daily Rountine Management System}

Please follow the [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) coding standard and the [PSR-4](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md) autoloading standard. In addition to these standards, the following coding standards should be followed:

- The class namespace declaration must be on the same line as `<?php`.
- A class' opening { must be on the same line as the class name.
- Functions and control structures must use Allman style braces.
- Indent with tabs, align with spaces.

HTML (blade/views)
==================

- Please add comments for each and every action/statement/block
- Format the code nicely (html open tag, close tag and content should be on separate lines)
- Please use spaces instead of tabs (convert tabs to space before commit).

The Golden Rules
=================

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts.
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- Although practicality beats purity.
- Errors should never pass silently.
- Unless explicitly silenced.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
- Now is better than never.
- Although never is often better than *right* now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
